 * Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.
 * For example, if the given sequence is “BBABCBCAB”, then the output should be 7
 * as “BABCBAB” is the longest palindromic subseuqnce in it. “BBBBB” and “BBCBB”
 * are also palindromic subsequences of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.

/**
 * The naive solution for this problem is to generate all subsequences of the given
 * sequence and find the longest palindromic subsequence. This solution is exponential
 * in term of time complexity. Let us see how this problem possesses both important
 * properties of a Dynamic Programming (DP) Problem and can efficiently solved
 * using Dynamic Programming.

Now we look for a smarter solution using Memoisation, let us understand what exactly is happening during recursion.

We have a string of length n, we compare the first and last characters of the string, if they are equal then we recurse
passing start+1 and end -1 recursively and at this point.
